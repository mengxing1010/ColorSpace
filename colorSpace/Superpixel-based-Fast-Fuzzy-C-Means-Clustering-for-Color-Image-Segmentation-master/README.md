# Superpixel-based-Fast-Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering-for-Color-Image-Segmentation
We propose a superpixel-based fast FCM (SFFCM) for color image segmentation. The proposed algorithm is able to achieve color image segmentation with a very low computational cost, yet achieve a high segmentation precision.
